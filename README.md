# YesChat-Chat-Programming
Project name is “YES Chat”. The name is chosen according to combination of group members names ([Y]iğit, [E]da, [S]amet). YesChat is a chat program. Simply, this program can create conversation between 2 users like other chat programs. But differently, first users set a keyword and messages are encrypted according to this keyword. The second user who wants to talk with first user should know the chosen keyword for decrypt the texts. So, other people will not be able to read if they crack the app or access to the new messages.
